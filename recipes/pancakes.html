    <p>Fluffy, sweet and filling. The <em>BEST</em> way to start your day!<br>
        For best results, make the batter the night before and refrigerate.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>300ml Semi-Skimmed Milk</li>
        <li>200g Plain Flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 tbsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Caster Sugar</li>
        <li>Olive Oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Flour, Baking Powder, Cinnamon and Sugar to a large bowl and mix together.</li>
        <li>Make a hole in the middle of the dry ingredients and crack the egg into the hole</li>
        <li>Gently beat the Egg in a circular motion into the surrounding flour. Add 100ml of<br>
        Milk once the mixture looks thick. Do this twice more until all the milk is in the mixture<br>
    and you have a smooth, silky batter.</li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of Olive Oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once hot, lower the heat and add two ladles of batter seperately into the pan</li>
        <li>When you notice bubbles appearing in the batter, flip each pancake over with a<br>
        Fish Slice and heat for another 30s-1min before removing to a plate.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process until you have the required number of pancakes, then serve<br>
        a stack to each person, pour over the syrup and enjoy!</li>
        <li>Store any remaining batter in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
